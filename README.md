## Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data for British Airways from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). The data was then cleaned and analyzed to get insights.
